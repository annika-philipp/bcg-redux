# bcg-redux

Play it on heroku https://bcg-redux.herokuapp.com/ This is a fully re-written and tested version of bcg3000, my question & answer game written as a personal project during EDA's bootcamp. 
bcg-redux adds redux to the software used and embraces tdd on the redux side. It also served as a testing ground for a deep dive into enzyme testing.
